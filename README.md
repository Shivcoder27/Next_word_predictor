# Next Word Predictor

## Overview
This project is a **Next Word Predictor**, which suggests the most probable next word based on the given input text. It is built using **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** techniques.

## Features
- Predicts the next word based on input text
- Uses **deep learning models** for accurate predictions
- Supports **custom datasets** for training
- Can be integrated into chatbots, search engines, or text-based applications

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivcoder27/Next_word_predictor.git
   cd Next_word_predictor
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

## Usage
Run the predictor script:
```bash
python predict.py
```
Type a sentence, and the model will suggest the next word.

## Training the Model
To train the model on your dataset:
```bash
python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset.txt
```
